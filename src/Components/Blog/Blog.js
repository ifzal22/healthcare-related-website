    <h1>The Benefits of Detoxification</h1>
    <p className='py-3'>Goodfood became publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The transaction, completed through a form of reverse takeover, raised $21 million of capital.[6] The funds raised were earmarked for growth and were used in large part to expand Goodfood's subscriber base and facility size. After the closing of the transaction, Goodfood began trading on the TSX under the ticker FOOD. The Company later raised additional equity to expand to Calgary, a second facility in Montreal and a new facility in Vancouver.[citation needed]

Goodfood experienced significant growth after going public: its subscriber base increased 35% to 31,000 in the quarter ending on August 31, 2017,[7] and another 45% to 45,000 in the quarter ending on November 31, 2017.[3] Goodfood reached the 200,000 mark as of August 31, 2019, with an increase of 125% in subscriber count year-over-year.[8]

As of November 30, 2020, Goodfood has 306,000 active subscribers.[9]</p>

    <h1>Cycling at Morning</h1>
    <p className='py-3 container'>Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.[5] They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.

Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation[6][7] optimal for short to moderate distances.

Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions,[8] and greatly reduced traffic congestion.[9] These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.[10]

As of November 30, 2020, Goodfood has 306,000 active subscribers.[9]</p>

    <h1>Running Every day</h1>
    <p className='py-3 container'>Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions).[1] This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.[2] A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity.[3] The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.

Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.[4]</p>
